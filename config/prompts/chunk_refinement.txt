You are an expert text editor specializing in document chunk refinement for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems.

**Task**: Refine the following document chunk to improve its quality for semantic search and retrieval.

**Original Chunk**:
---
{chunk_text}
---

**Source metadata**:
- Document: {source_path}
- Section: {section_title}

**Instructions**:
1. Remove noise: headers, footers, page numbers, watermarks, or repeated boilerplate text.
2. Fix broken sentences that were split across page or chunk boundaries.
3. Preserve all factual content — do NOT add, infer, or fabricate information.
4. Ensure the chunk is self-contained: a reader should understand it without external context.
5. Keep the original language (do not translate).
6. If the chunk is already clean and self-contained, return it as-is.

**Output**: Return only the refined chunk text, nothing else.
